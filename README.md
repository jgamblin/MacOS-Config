# MacOS-Config
Simple shell scripts I use to tweak MacOS to my liking.

## Usage:

- `BrewConfig.sh` Installs and updates HomeBrew and tools I like.
- `OSConfig.sh` Tweaks OS sittings to how I like them.  
- `BrewCask.sh` Download automatically software to how I need them  .  
- `UnsplashBackground.sh` Downloads an amazing image from Unsplash and sets it as the background.

## Important Notice
I likely dont know what I am doing and this could be done faster, better and simpler some other way. These scripts could also break your MacBook and make you cry.
